\section{Theoretical part}
The Randomized Rounding algorithm picks a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of sets to include in
the final solution. We wish to find the probability that at least $\frac{n}{2}$ sets and
the total cost of the sets $c(\mathcal{C})$ is less than $O(OPT)$.

We will equivalently bound the probability that the number of uncovered elements, $|NC|$,
exceeds $\frac{n}{2}$, and that $c(\mathcal{C}) \geq O(OPT_f)$. We will bound these seperately
and combine them by union bound.

\paragraph{Case 1 ( $c(\mathcal{C}) \geq O(OPT_f)$):}
We note that we have,
$$\EE[\mathrm{cost}(\mathcal{C})] = \mathrm{OPT}_f\mathnormal{.}$$
By applying Markov's inequality, we get
\begin{align*}
\PP[\mathrm{cost}(\mathcal{C}) \geq O(\mathrm{OPT}_f)]
  \leq \frac{\mathrm{OPT}_f}{O(\mathrm{OPT}_f)}
  = \frac{1}{c}
\end{align*}
for some constant, $c$.

\paragraph{Case 2 ($|NC| \geq \frac{n}{2}$):}
We have that the probability that an element, $a$, is uncovered, $a \in NC$, is the following
$$\PP[a \in NC] \leq \frac{1}{e}$$
\citep[p. 121]{Vaz}.
Then we have that the expected number of uncovered elements is the following,
$$\EE[|NC|] = \sum_a \PP[a \in NC] \leq \frac{n}{e}\mathnormal{.}$$
Then we can derive a bound, by applying Markov's inequality again,
\begin{align*}
  \PP[|NC| \geq \frac{n}{2}] \leq \frac{\EE[|NC|]}{\frac{n}{2}} 
                             \leq \frac{\frac{n}{e}}{\frac{n}{2}} 
                             = \frac{2}{e}\mathnormal{.}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Combined Bound}
We then combine the bounds by union bound which gives us
$$\PP\left[\mathrm{cost}(\mathcal{C}) \geq O(\mathrm{OPT}_f) \vee  |NC| \geq \frac{n}{2} \right]
\leq \frac{1}{c} + \frac{2}{e}$$
for some constant $c$.

\section{Implementation part}

We report the best Solutions in Table 1 and Computational Time in Table 2 against each of the instances for each of the methods. For the two tables, n represents number of times run. As well Simplified Rounding is represented by (SR), Randomized Rounding by (RR), Primal-Dual Method(PDM).

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
    Instance& $n$& CPLEX(ILP)&CPLEX(LP)&SR&RR&PDM  \\\hline
    scpa3.dat &$10$&$232$ & $228$ & $490$& $369$ & $448$  \\
    scpc3.dat &$10$&$243$ & $234.58$ & $587$& $442.7$ & $463$ \\
    scpnrf1.dat &$10$&$14$ & $8.8$ & $78$& $29.7$ & $43.0$  \\
    scpnrg5.dat &$10$&-- & $148.23$ & $621$& $382.1$ & $412$  \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Results of methods on their Solution Value}
  \label{tab:res}
\end{table}

We note that the approximated solutions given by our three methods generally have about double the cost of the optimal solution to the ILP.
Moreover, the RR and PDM methods seem to give tighter approximations than the SR method. RR and PDM are comparatively close, but RR outperforms PDM
on two of the datasets.

Since all of the approximation methods are $f$-approximations \citep[pp. 118-131]{Vaz} they all stay well within their ``guarantees''.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
    Instance& $n$& CPLEX(ILP)&SR&RR&PDM \\\hline
    scpa3.dat &$10$&$724.0$ & $238.4$& $239.5$ & $238.5$  \\
    scpc3.dat &$10$ & $3400.3$ & $359.4$& $363.8$ & $368.0$ \\
    scpnrf1.dat	 &$10$ & $28383.5$ & $5506.4$& $5552.0$ & $5629.8$  \\
    scpnrg5.dat &$10$ & -- & $1931.3$& $1926.0$ & $1925.8$  \\\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Results for Computational Time in ms}
  \label{tab:time}
\end{table}


 Unsurprisingly, the approximation methods run much faster than Cplex takes to find the exact solution. All three of our methods take pretty much the same amount of time,
  which could indicate that the majority of the time is spent on solving the LP relaxation.
